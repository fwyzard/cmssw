## HeterogeneousCore/AlpakaServicesSerialSync

This is a dummy package to emulate the expected behaviour of the build system.
The .../alpaka/ directories are symlinked from HeterogeneousCore/AlpakaServices
to avoid the scram error about the inclusion of private source files.
Its content should eventually be built from HeterogeneousCore/AlpakaServices for
the serial sync backend.
